<h1>IoT-Enhanced Autonomous Mushroom Growing System</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>The traditional approach to mushroom cultivation necessitates constant human supervision to uphold vital environmental conditions, hindering both scalability and efficient resource utilization. The challenge at hand is to develop an innovative solution that leverages IoT technologies to create a self-sustaining cultivation system capable of maintaining optimal growing conditions and adapting to changing requirements without the need for extensive human labor.</p>

<h2>Research Problem</h2>
<p>Growing Mushrooms always tend to need human supervision for keeping healthy environment factors. So, maintaining a large-scale plantation needs more human labor and time. Hence automated system is required</p>

<h2>Overall Aim</h2>
<p>Create an IOT-based System to get a healthy Mushroom Production with minimal Human supervision.</p>

<h2>Objectives Of The Project</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Objective 1:Maintain Soil moisture in the system.</li>
  <li>Objective 2:Maintain Humidity level in 50% - 70% in the system.</li>
  <li>Objective 3:Maintain CO2 level in the system.</li>
  <li>Objective 4:Create MQTT server connection and Node Red dashboard.</li>
</ul>
